# DP-Long-term-optimal-scheduling-of-reservoirs
Application of dynamic programming algorithms to long-term optimal scheduling of reservoirs

采用动态规划算法进行互补系统长期优化调度，互补系统包括水电、风电、光电，调度目标为系统发电量最大

Dynamic planning algorithms are used for long-term optimal scheduling of complementary systems, which include hydropower, wind power, and photovoltaic power, and the scheduling objective is to maximize the system's power output

项目中main.py为主文件，data.xlsx为输入数据，计算结果.xlsx为实例的计算结果

In the project, main.py is the main file, data.xlsx is the input data, and calculation result.xlsx is the calculation result of the example
